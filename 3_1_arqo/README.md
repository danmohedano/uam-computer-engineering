# Computer Architecture (Year 3 - Semester 1)

- `P1`: Implementation of single-cycle and pipeline MIPS processors in VHDL. 
- `P2`: Upgrade for the pipeline processor (forwarding unit, etc.)
- `P3`: Study of memory access through matrix handling. Used to see how performance varies with the way the matrices are accessed (row-wise vs column-wise) because of the loading of memory pages in cache.
- `P4`: Application of OpenMP for parallel programming in C.
