: Quiet, quiet, quiet, QUIETA  There are ways of *telling* whether she
   is a witch!
Villagers: Are there?  What?  Tell us, then!  Tell us!
B: Tell me.  What do you do with witches?
V: BUUUURN!!!!! BUUUUUURRRRNN!!!!!  You BURN them!!!!  BURN!!
B: And what do you burn apart from witches?
Villager: More Witches!
Other Villager: Wood.
B: So.  Why do witches burn?
 
(long silence)
(shuffling of feet by the villagers)
 
Villager: (tentatively) Because they're made of.....wood?
B: Goooood!
Other Villagers:  oh yeah... oh....
B: So.  How do we tell whether she is made of wood?
One Villager: Build a bridge out of 'er!
B: Aah.  But can you not also make bridges out of stone?
Villagers: oh yeah. oh.  umm...
B: Does wood sink in water?
One Villager: No! No, no, it floats!
Other Villager: Throw her into the pond!
Villagers: yaaaaaa!
 
(when order is restored)
 
B: What also floats in water?
Villager: Bread!
Another Villager: Apples!
Another Villager: Uh...very small rocks!
Another Villager: Cider!
Another Villager: Uh...great gravy!
Another Villager: Cherries!
Another Villager: Mud!
Another Villager: Churches! Churches!
Another Villager: Lead! Lead!
King Arthur: A Duck!
Villagers: (in amazement) ooooooh!
B: exACTly!
B: (to a villager) So, *logically*...
Villager: (very slowly, with pauses between each word)
          If...she...weighs the same as a duck......she's made of wood.
B: and therefore...
 
(pause)
 
Villager: A Witch!
All Villagers: A WITCH!
 
(they do consequently weigh her across from a duck on Bedevere's largest
 scale, and she does indeed weigh the same as the duck.)
 
Witch: (to camera) It's a fair cop.
